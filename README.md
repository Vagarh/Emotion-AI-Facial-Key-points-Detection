# Course Objectives

In this course, we are going to focus on the following learning objectives:

- Understand the theory and intuition behind Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
- Import key Python libraries, datasets, and perform image visualization.
- Perform data pre-processing and data exploration.
- Perform data augmentation and image normalization.
- Build a deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Residual blocks using Keras with TensorFlow 2.0 as a back-end.
- Compile and fit a Deep Convolutional Neural Network model to training data.
- Assess the performance of the trained Convolutional Neural Network model and ensure its generalization using various KPIs.
